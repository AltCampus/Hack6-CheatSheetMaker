# REFACTOR FILENAMES

### Relocate and remove versioned files

## \$ git rm [file]

### Deletes the file from the working directory and stages the deletion

## \$ git rm --cached [file]

### Removes the file from version control but preserves the file locally

## \$ git mv [file-original][file-renamed]

### Changes the file name and prepares it for commit
